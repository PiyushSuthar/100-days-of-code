# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Mern Bootcamp By Hiesh Choudhary (I had left in the middle), Made a bot for posting meme on Instagram (I Love Memes ‚ù§)
<!--
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
